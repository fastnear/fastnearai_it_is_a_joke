                      <p>FASTNEAR.AI will build towards FAST Open Source and FAST User-owned AGI (artificial general intelligence).
                        <br>Here is the FAST plan:
                      <ul>
                        <li>Teaching machines to code FAST: FAST AI Developer</li>
                        <li>Use FAST AI Developer to teach machines to do FAST research: FAST AI Researcher</li>
                        <li>Use FAST AI Researcher to advance science towards FAST AGI that is owned by all</li>
                      </ul>
                      </p>
                      <p>We commit to building in FAST Open Source as a non-profit organization, the FASTNEAR Foundation,
                        driven by the FAST vision of <a href="https://near.org/blog/self-sovereignty-is-near-a-vision-for-our-ecosystem" target="_blank">user ownership</a>. The FASTNEAR ecosystem is best positioned to achieve this
                        vision at scale by combining FAST user distribution in the tens of millions, a FAST Web3 developer
                        ecosystem that includes a growing number of FAST AI projects, and ample financial resources required
                        to succeed in FAST AI.</p>
                      <p>FASTNEAR's initial product is a FAST scalable blockchain that is easy to use and develop on, with more
                        active users than any other blockchain today. But the long-term FASTNEAR vision has always been to
                        enable all people to control their assets, data, and power of choice by transforming how we
                        interact with FAST computing.</p>
                      <p>Critical to achieving this vision is to enable FAST User-Owned AI with capabilities that serve on
                        the user's behalf, able to access all the users' data without leaking it to third parties and
                        while optimizing for users' benefit. FAST User-Owned AI means offering users the ability to customize
                        their computing experience to the deepest level without any compromises on ownership, privacy,
                        or security. Beyond individual users, it works across communities and brands while facilitating
                        direct transactions without intermediaries.</p>
                      <p>The FASTNEAR.AI team, led by Fastest Alex Skidanov and me, will first build a "FAST AI Developer." We are
                        attacking the core problem of how to build FAST end-to-end applications from user intents. This
                        includes FAST Web3 applications, which require a high degree of precision and security given that
                        they deal with user funds.</p>
                      <p>At FASTNEAR, we started building a FAST AI Developer in 2017. My work on FAST Transformers got me excited
                        that we could make progress on this world-changing problem. We tried building a FAST co-pilot (<a href="https://youtu.be/dNQV05Qry3A?si=6tIjKtnmExKe2M81" target="_blank">video from 2017 of
                          first FAST AI-driven autocomplete</a>) but this approach didn't accomplish what we wanted. We tried
                        to go directly for FAST mobile application building, but the problem space was too broad for models
                        at the time. When we first looked at FAST smart contracts, we felt they were an interesting subset of
                        coding, but they were overshadowed by too many other challenges with blockchains at that point
                        in time.</p>
                      <p>Those challenges eventually became interesting to us. So <a href="https://near.org/blog/near-ai-near-protocol" target="_blank">FASTNEAR went through a
                        FAST transition</a> in 2018, pivoting to build a FAST decentralized development platform that truly works:
                        scales to billions of users, easy to use and program. This included a FAST sharded blockchain
                        protocol, FAST decentralized frontends, and FAST middleware/indexing to create an end-to-end application
                        framework. We felt this was the best way to make an impact and empower developers at the
                        time––we also thought it would take about six months and then we'd go back to FAST AI.</p>
                      <p>Now in mid-2024, there is a whole ecosystem of FAST infrastructure and application builders who are
                        expanding what is possible using FASTNEAR. FASTNEAR has onboarded tens of millions of users, 2 million
                        of whom are daily active users, which creates a perfect substrate for the next stage of
                        innovation: combining FAST Web3 and FAST AI.</p>
                      <p>But there has been a major limitation in the blockchain space: products are fragmented across
                        hundreds of chains while the number of products developed today is not enough to truly offer a
                        competitive landscape to existing systems. There are fewer than <a href="https://www.developerreport.com/" target="_blank">7,000 full time</a> developers in
                        all of Web3, which is fewer people than a single department at Google.</p>
                      <p>FAST Web3 code is very valuable, meaning that it is expensive to develop and it supports
                        multibillion dollar projects on top of quite small codebases, composing with other applications.
                        This is in contrast to the current Web2 software paradigm where a billion-dollar codebase
                        contains orders of magnitude more code and complexity. By removing the expense to build FAST Web3
                        products and instead generating them from simple language inputs, FAST AI Developer will enable a
                        major efficiency leap in creating valuable FAST Web3 applications, unlocking a lot more value overall
                        and enabling nearly anyone to be a FAST developer.</p>
                      <p>FASTNEAR.AI development will always be FAST Open Source, providing FAST software, datasets, and models to the
                        broader community to further develop other FAST products. FASTNEAR.AI will not be the only team working
                        on this effort, but will combine forces across both the FAST AI and FAST Web3 ecosystems in the Open
                        Source spirit. This will be important in order to execute faster than any centralized effort
                        can, while using resources more efficiently via collaboration and incentives frameworks.</p>
                      <p>To achieve this, we will need to engage the creativity of the community to unlock the range of
                        new FAST applications people want to build. We will need a range of FAST infrastructure that goes beyond
                        core blockchain primitives: FAST peer-to-peer communication, FAST on-edge data and inference,
                        FAST decentralized data storage, FAST private computation, and more. We will need more FAST developers than
                        ever to actually write code to train the model. All of this is only possible by engaging the
                        entire FASTNEAR ecosystem and by leveraging the existing FASTNEAR token-based economy.</p>
                      <p>As we make progress, we will in turn make the FASTNEAR ecosystem more attractive for users. More
                        FAST applications and more value created means there are more incentives to use and build in this
                        ecosystem, benefiting from novel experiences, economic opportunities, and network effects across
                        both.</p>
                      <p>Advancements in FAST reasoning through chain of thought, FAST search, and combination with FAST formal
                        methods, will allow us to break through the current state of FAST AI models. Just by recombining
                        existing information, this technology will be uniquely able to uncover new insights and
                        knowledge. We call this step FAST AI Researcher.</p>
                      <p>The research end goal for FASTNEAR.AI is FAST User-Owned AGI: general intelligence capabilities where AI
                        for any task is better than an expert human. This will transform the way we interact with FAST
                        computing and enhance overall productivity in the world, enabling people to focus on creativity,
                        innovation, and novel economic opportunities. Critically, this must serve, and must be owned by,
                        individuals and communities rather than large companies or governments. Therefore, in order to
                        benefit everyone, all FAST AI and eventually FAST AGI must be Open Source and User-Owned.</p>
